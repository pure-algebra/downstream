# Whatwg source routing

This boundary contains the Lean library's semantic declarations and proofs.
The repository root rules remain in force; `docs/AGENT-ROUTING.md` defines how
these source rules connect to tests, host evidence, and generated assurance.

## Before a declaration changes

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the relevant `SPEC-MANIFEST.md` disposition, the
frozen contract, and every linked row in `test/counterexamples/REGISTER.md`.
Check the current per-declaration assurance snapshot when it exists.

Every public declaration must have a lightweight ownership, disposition, and
duplicate-prevention record. Every public type must already have an authored
existing-type row with one owner, its semantic role, and the spec anchor it
models: the algorithm name, internal slot, or IDL member in the pinned
`index.bs`, with that anchor's span digest. The row selects either a required
proof graph or a local receipt set marked `standalone` or linked to a named
parent-graph edge. A new native type names the contract that fixed its role.
Empty source stubs with no exported declarations need neither record nor
graph.

Do not create a carrier because an implementation needs a convenient local
shape. Reuse the canonical owner, add a named view or adapter, or state that a
family is a separate calculus. A second representation requires an explicit
conversion, embedding, erasure, or refusal theorem and an annotation naming
the canonical carrier. Raw and checked forms, syntax and denotation, and host
views remain distinct for stated reasons; copied constructors do not
establish a distinction.

## The spec is the authority, not the hosts

A declaration models a named algorithm or slot of the pinned specification
source. Where the specification is written as requirements rather than an
algorithm, the declaration models the requirement as a specification and
treats the reference implementation's algorithm as one candidate realizer;
it does not promote the reference implementation to the meaning. Host
behaviour observed under Node, Bun, or the reference implementation is
evidence about that host profile and never repairs a theorem statement.

## Proof work

The builder does not edit the breaker-authored contract or red battery. Public
claims name the exact judgment and observation mask. Bounded execution does
not replace relational or big-step meaning, and host execution does not prove
a Lean theorem.

Use `docs/AGENT-ROUTING.md`'s threshold. Admission or refusal, judgments,
denotation, interpreters, state-machine transition laws, semantic
reification or refinement, generated-code relations, nontrivial composition
or recursive invariants, external semantic equivalence, and independently
owned direct cutover conditions require a proof graph. A passive finite leaf
alphabet or value record may instead close with its exact local theorem
receipts. It is marked standalone, or names the parent-graph edge to which it
contributes. Escalate the row before adding a graph-bearing claim, retaining
every former receipt as a graph obligation unless an explicit supersession
ruling replaces it.

For a graph-bearing type, update or close only the edges for which evidence now
exists: identity, construction, semantics, laws, representation,
counterexamples, bridges, targets, trust, and coverage. For a leaf, update only
its declared signature, census, round-trip, separation, embedding, and axiom
receipts. New axioms or opaque trust boundaries require an explicit authored
admission and an axiom receipt. Compilation alone closes no semantic edge or
leaf theorem receipt.

A theorem written to witness a specification algorithm names the census row
id from `generated/spec-algorithm-census.tsv` in its docstring and is joined
test-side in `WhatwgTest/Audit/SpecCoverage.lean`; the theorem alone
moves no coverage number. `docs/SPEC-COVERAGE.md` owns the rules.

The narrow test, default Lake build, axiom inspection, and relevant generated
drift gate must run before a source handoff. Report open graph edges and leaf
receipts without rounding them up to category completion.

## Ceiling

Every declaration in this tree is bound by the ceiling `propext`,
`Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice` (ruling R-11). `sorry`, `native_decide`,
`bv_decide`, `partial`, `unsafe`, and new axioms are rejected by
`WhatwgTest/Audit/AxiomGate.lean`. There is no per-module exemption
in this tree because none is needed.
