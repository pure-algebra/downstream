# Data.Queue.lean

Owner: the queue-with-sizes carrier, a chunk queue paired with its total
size, and the enqueue, dequeue and reset operations over it as total
functions with their size invariant.

Spec anchors: `queue-with-sizes`.

Opens in P3.

The public surface below is the one frozen by
`test/contracts/queue-with-sizes.contract.md` (D0 through D4) and ascribed by
`WhatwgTest/Streams/Data/QueueContract.lean`. Every definition is a
transcription of the census row named in its docstring, read from the pinned
bytes of `vendor/whatwg-streams-b9ba9f49/index.bs` at the span that
`generated/spec-algorithm-census.tsv` records for that row.

The size carrier is abstract: the operations take a `SizeClass` record rather
than a concrete numeric type, so ruling `P3-R1` selects an instance and never
a statement. The `Classified`, `Ordered` and `Exact` predicates are the three
carrier properties the laws are stated against; a concrete instance
satisfying all three is owed by `P3-R1` in a module this packet does not
fence.

`[[queueTotalSize]]` is: census row `slot.queue-total-size`, span digest
`f0d6bce926812e0c273583abd237b16959d31ab1169c6c2b30f0f0268f5b0659`, whose
pinned text reads "`[[queueTotalSize]]` is a JavaScript `Number`, i.e. a
double-precision floating point number".

This record is an interface, not a carrier. `nan`, `posInfinity` and
`negInfinity` are **fields** rather than derived predicates so that an
instance is forced to exhibit the three special values: on a carrier that
cannot represent them, every refusal law of this packet is satisfied by an
implementation that refuses nothing, which is counterexample
`WS-DATA-CE-007`.

What this interface deliberately does not carry is the rounding of the host's
binary64 arithmetic; that is foreign boundary `DATA-FB-ROUNDING`. -/

"If `|v|` is not a Number, return false. If `|v|` is NaN, return false. If
`|v|` &lt; 0, return false. Return true."

Step 1 is a Web IDL type test with no counterpart on a typed carrier, and is
foreign boundary `DATA-FB-IDL-DOUBLE`; steps 2 and 3 are the two conjuncts
below. `+∞` passes this predicate, which is why `EnqueueValueWithSize` needs
its second refusal step. -/
def isNonNegativeNumber (sizes : SizeClass Size) (v : Size) : Bool :=
  !sizes.isNaN v && !sizes.isNegative v

/-- "If `|size|` is +∞" of `EnqueueValueWithSize` step 3: infinite and not
negative. It is a second predicate rather than a clause of
`isNonNegativeNumber` because the two refusal sets differ on exactly this
value — `+∞` is a legal high water mark — which is counterexample
`WS-DATA-CE-008`. -/
def isPositiveInfinity (sizes : SizeClass Size) (v : Size) : Bool :=
  sizes.isInfinite v && !sizes.isNegative v

/-- The set of sizes `EnqueueValueWithSize` appends: not `NaN`, not negative,
not infinite. It is the conjunction of the two refusal steps read positively,

reading is exact. -/

`|container|.[[queueTotalSize]]` &lt; 0, set `|container|.[[queueTotalSize]]`
to 0. (This can occur due to rounding errors.)"

The step is modelled under every answer to `P3-R1`. Under an exact carrier it
is additionally proved unreachable by
`dequeueValue_clamp_unreachable_of_exact`, which is the honest reading of the
specification's own parenthesis once rounding is outside the model. -/

/-! ## D2 — the three carrier property predicates -/

/-- The three special constants are classified as the pinned text classifies
them. Without this predicate an instance could declare `nan` to be an
ordinary non-negative number and satisfy every refusal law vacuously
(`WS-DATA-CE-007`). -/

/-- The admissible sizes are closed under the arithmetic the queue performs.
`add_admissible` is where overflow lives: it holds of an unbounded carrier and
fails of a bounded one, which is a second, independent way ruling `P3-R1`
shows up in the statements. -/

/-- Exactness of the carrier's arithmetic on admissible sizes. Every equation
is guarded by `Admissible`: unguarded they are false of any carrier that has a
`NaN`, since `sub_add_cancel a nan` would demand `nan = a`, and a predicate no
instance satisfies makes every law depending on it vacuous.

This is the predicate ruling `P3-R1` turns on. Option (i), the ruled answer,
has an instance that satisfies it; a rounding carrier does not, and
`WS-DATA-CE-001` is the pinned run that falsifies `sub_add_cancel` there. -/

the pinned text calls "two paired internal slots, always named `[[queue]]` and
`[[queueTotalSize]]`" and keeps synchronized through the four operations
below.

The synchronization is `Queue.WF`, a separate decidable `Prop` rather than a
field invariant, because the pinned text's own warning denies it: keeping a
running total "is *not* equivalent to adding up the size of all chunks in
`[[queue]]`". A structure that made the invariant unconstructible-otherwise
could not represent the specification's own reachable states. -/
structure Queue (α : Type u) (Size : Type u) : Type u where

It is a **left** fold from `zero`, in the order `EnqueueValueWithSize`
accumulates. The direction is not cosmetic: `WS-DATA-CE-002` exhibits a
carrier and a three-entry queue on which the two fold directions differ, and
the left fold is the one that makes `enqueueValueWithSize_wf` a one-step
argument. -/

1. Assert: `|container|` has `[[queue]]` and `[[queueTotalSize]]` internal
   slots — vacuous here, since the type carries both.
2. "If ! `IsNonNegativeNumber(|size|)` is false, throw a `RangeError`
   exception."
3. "If `|size|` is +∞, throw a `RangeError` exception."
4. "Append a new value-with-size with value `|value|` and size `|size|` to
   `|container|.[[queue]]`."
5. "Set `|container|.[[queueTotalSize]]` to `|container|.[[queueTotalSize]]` +
   `|size|`."

The two refusals are two separate steps in a fixed order, and both precede the
append: a model that appends first lets the running total go negative while
the queue is non-empty (`WS-DATA-CE-003`). Step 4 appends;
`WS-DATA-CE-010` is the stack that prepends and keeps every other law. -/

7. "Return `|valueWithSize|`'s value."

Step 2's assertion is modelled by the `Option`, and `dequeueValue_isNone_iff`
is the theorem that the refusing arm is reached on exactly the empty queue: an
assertion is not a runtime check, so a model is otherwise free to answer with
a default, which is `WS-DATA-CE-004`. -/

It touches neither slot, and the signature says so: no `SizeClass` argument
and no queue in the result. `WS-DATA-CE-005` is the popping mutant, which
returns the right value and is caught only by the container it hands back —
a mutation this result type cannot express. -/

`WS-DATA-CE-006` is the reset that keeps a drifted running total. -/
