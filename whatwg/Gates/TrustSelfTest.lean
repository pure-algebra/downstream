# Gates.TrustSelfTest

Exercises the elaboration-time trust gate in `WhatwgTest/Audit/AxiomGate.lean`
by planting declarations it must reject and confirming it rejects them for
the stated reason.

The gate runs in the root aggregator `WhatwgTest.lean`, which Lake
builds last. Any earlier module that fails to build prevents the gate from
running at all, so a red tree would make the planted checks meaningless. The
breaker/builder discipline deliberately keeps frozen batteries red before
their builder lands. This self-test therefore:

1. copies the Lean sources into a throwaway directory;
2. builds once and requires the set of failing modules to equal the declared
   set in `test/fixtures/trust-gate/known-red.txt`, in both directions;
3. excises the declared red modules from the copy; and
4. runs the planted-declaration checks against a genuinely green tree.

Run `lake exe trustselftest` from anywhere inside the checkout. It invokes
`lake build` in the throwaway copy through the same toolchain.

## Cost

The probe is seeded with the checkout's own `.lake/build` and
`.lake/packages` when they exist. Lake's traces are content hashes, not
paths, so the seeded probe replays every module that is unchanged and each
planted variant costs one incremental build of the roots it touches (a few
seconds), instead of a from-scratch build of the package and its
dependencies for the first control and a cold cache for every plant after
it. A checkout with no build directory still works; it just pays the cold
build once. The first control build doubles as the green control when no
red module is declared, so an all-green tree runs one fewer build.
